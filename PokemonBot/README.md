# Pokemon Bot README

## Project Overview:

- Develop a Pokemon bot using discord.py to bring a fun and interactive experience to Discord servers.
- Allow users to catch, train, battle, and trade Pokemon within the server.

## Features:

- Catch Pokemon in designated channels by using a command to randomly encounter a Pokemon.
- Train Pokemon by gaining experience points through participating in battles or completing tasks.
- Battle other users' Pokemon using a command that initiates a turn-based battle system.
- Trade Pokemon with other users by agreeing on a trade and confirming it with the bot.
- View a detailed Pokemon profile that includes stats, moves, and level.
- Earn badges by defeating gym leaders in special events or challenges.
- Participate in server-wide tournaments for prizes and recognition.
- Customize your trainer avatar with different outfits and accessories.
- Join a Pokemon league within the server to compete against other trainers.
- Receive notifications for special in-game events or limited-time offers.
- Implement a leveling system for trainers based on their Pokemon training progress.
- Include a Pokemon storage system to manage a collection of caught Pokemon efficiently.

## Enhancements:

- Add a feature to evolve Pokemon after reaching a certain level or fulfilling specific conditions.
- Include a mini-game option where trainers can earn rewards or special items.
- Integrate a trading marketplace for users to buy and sell Pokemon with in-game currency.
- Implement a bot command for users to request battles or trades with specific trainers.
- Include a daily login bonus system to reward active trainers.
- Introduce legendary Pokemon as rare encounters with unique abilities and stats.
- Create special events with themed challenges, such as seasonal events or holiday-themed activities.

## Programming Languages:

- Python for backend development using discord.py for Discord bot creation.

## APIs:

- Discord API for bot integration to interact with Discord servers and users.

## Packages and Libraries:

- discord.py (v1.7.3) for creating the Discord bot and handling interactions.
- Pandas (v1.3.3) for managing data related to Pokemon profiles, stats, and levels.
- Random (built-in) for generating random encounters and events within the game.
- SQLite3 (built-in) for creating a database to store user and Pokemon data efficiently.
